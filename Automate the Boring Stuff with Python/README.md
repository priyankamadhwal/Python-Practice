**1. GUESS THE NUMBER GAME**  
This script is an interactive guessing game, which will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 30. It will tell you if each guess is too high or too low. You win if you can guess the number within 10 tries.   
     
**2. THE COLLATZ SEQUENCE**  
This is a Python program to test Collatz conjecture for a given number.  
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture that a particular sequence always reaches 1. The sequence is defined as: start with a number n. The next number in the sequence is n/2 if n is even and 3n + 1 if n is odd.   
  
**3. COMMA CODE**  
Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with 'and' inserted before the last item.  
    
**4. CHARACTER PICTURE GRID**    
Given a grid which is list of lists where each value in the inner lists is a one-character string.  
You can think of grid[x][y] as being the character at the x- and y-coordinates of a “picture” drawn with text characters. The (0, 0) origin will be in the upper-left corner, the x-coordinates increase going right, and the y-coordinates increase going down.  
Use the grid to print an image.
    
**5. TIC-TAC-TOE**    
Two people play Tic Tac Toe with paper and pencil. One player is X and the other player is O. Players take turns placing their X or O. If a player gets three of their marks on the board in a row, column or one of the two diagonals, they win. When the board fills up with neither player winning, the game ends in a draw.
