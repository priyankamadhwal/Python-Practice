**1. THE COLLATZ SEQUENCE**  
This is a Python program to test Collatz conjecture for a given number.  
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture that a particular sequence always reaches 1. The sequence is defined as: start with a number n. The next number in the sequence is n/2 if n is even and 3n + 1 if n is odd.   
  
**2. COMMA CODE**  
Write a function that takes a list value as an argument and returns a string with all the items separated by a comma and a space, with 'and' inserted before the last item.  
    
**3. CHARACTER PICTURE GRID**    
Given a grid which is list of lists where each value in the inner lists is a one-character string.  
You can think of grid[x][y] as being the character at the x- and y-coordinates of a “picture” drawn with text characters. The (0, 0) origin will be in the upper-left corner, the x-coordinates increase going right, and the y-coordinates increase going down.  
Use the grid to print an image.
   
**4. FANTASY GAME INVENTORY**   
You are creating a fantasy video game. The data structure to model the player’s inventory will be a dictionary where the keys are string values describing the item in the inventory and the value is an integer value detailing how many of that item the player has.  
Write a function named displayInventory() that would take any possible “inventory” and display it.   
Write a function named addToInventory(inventory, addedItems), where the inventory parameter is a dictionary representing the player’s inventory and the addedItems parameter is a listt. It returns an updated inventory.    
    
**5. TABLE PRINTER**   
A function named printTable() that takes a list of lists of strings and displays it in a well-organized table with each column right-justified.   
   
**6. STRONG PASSWORD DETECTION**   
Write a function that uses regular expressions to make sure the password string it is passed is strong. A strong password is defined as one that is at least eight characters long, contains both uppercase and lowercase characters, and has at least one digit.  
  
**7. REGEX VERSION OF STRIP()**   
Write a function that takes a string and does the same thing as the strip() string method. If no other arguments are passed other than the string to strip, then whitespace characters will be removed from the beginning and end of the string. Otherwise, the characters specified in the second argument to the function will be removed from the string.
