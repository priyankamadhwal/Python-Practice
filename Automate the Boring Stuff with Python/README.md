**1. GUESS THE NUMBER GAME**  
This script is an interactive guessing game, which will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 30. It will tell you if each guess is too high or too low. You win if you can guess the number within 10 tries.   
     
**2. THE COLLATZ SEQUENCE**  
This is a Python program to test Collatz conjecture for a given number.  
The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture that a particular sequence always reaches 1. The sequence is defined as: start with a number n. The next number in the sequence is n/2 if n is even and 3n + 1 if n is odd.
